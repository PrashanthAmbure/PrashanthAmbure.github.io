Hi, I'm Prashanth. A Computer Science Grad from Jaya Prakash Narayan College (affiliation of JNTU), Mahabubnagar currently working as Consultant for Deloitte after having worked for more than 1 Year with Imaginea, BU of Pramati Technologies and 4 years with Vitech Systems Asia.

Focus of  work so far has been on exploring frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, Tapestry and build tool Maven when associated with Vitech Systems Asia, this was the place where I got a chance to work on the most intelligent and smitten architecture, an architecture which would be fascinated amidst the great programmers for next 2 decades atleast. It was with Pramati when I was waked up saying the industry is diversified and there's lots happening with frontend frameworks and that's when I started exploring Angular JS, Mongo DB, Node JS. Apart from working I spend my time exploring open source technologies.

On a social note,

* I'm a big foodie who loves eating a wide variety of foods.
* Love travelling, go out for long drives every now and there.
* I like playing outdoor sports, badminton and cricket being my favorite.

I would like to engross myself in a place where a significant portion of the greatest progammers live, eat, code, read, listen and work!
