title: MEAN stack application
---

**MEAN** is a acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js - incidentally all these are JavaScript-based technologies used to develop web applications and it's a popular web development stack. MEAN stack enables a perfect harmony of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) development: MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format, Express and Node.js facilitate easy JSON query creation, and AngularJS allows the client to seamlessly send and receive JSON documents.

MEAN is generally used to create browser-based web applications because AngularJS (client-side) and Express (server-side) are both frameworks for web apps.

I've developed a application which supports standard [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations. [Click here](https://github.com/PrashanthAmbure/mean-app).
